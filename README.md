# SNHU-CS-300
The problems I dealt with throughout this course involved different data models and how to implement them with their appropriate use cases. When approaching each problem throughout this course I would look at the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and based on the needs of the project would determine which data structures strengths suited the given problem. One roadblock I came across was refreshing my memory on linked lists and their different applications. In order to overcome this, I read through documentation and referred to peers for assistence whenever I needed it. Going over big-O analysis has made me rethink my own programming in regards to its performance and how I approach algorithm problems. Overall, this project has given me the tools I need to effectively approach different algorithm problems and ensure that my code is readable and especially reusable now for different programs.
